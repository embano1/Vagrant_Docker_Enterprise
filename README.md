# Vagrantfile to set up a demo environment for an Enterprise (on-prem) Docker Environment

**1. About**
  * Vagrantfile and scripts to stand up a 3+ (configurable) node VMware PhotonOS deployment (harbor, admiral, up to two workers) based on VMware PhotonOS, VMware Admiral (Container Host Management) and VMware Harbor (Docker Registry)
  * See @vmtocloud Â´s blog articles [e.g. here](http://www.vmtocloud.com/how-to-use-vmware-admiral-container-service-with-harbor-registry/) or the user guides on [Harbor](https://github.com/vmware/harbor/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md) and [Admiral](https://github.com/vmware/admiral#getting-started) for some better understanding of the products

**2. Notes, Pre-Reqs and tested environment**
  * Tested on OSX 10.11.6, Vagrant 1.8.1 (see [issue w/ Vagrant > 1.8.1 #7808](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/7808), Virtualbox 5.0.26
  * Please see [Issues](https://github.com/embano1/Vagrant_Docker_Enterprise/issues) section for planned improvements and current issues
  * The Admiral node requires 1 vCPU and 2GB MEM, Harbor 1 vCPU and 1GB MEM, workers are configured for 1 vCPU and 512MB MEM
  * It is also possible to just launch some of the boxes ("vagrant up admiral worker-1"), e.g. in case of resource constraints
  * Depending on your connection, pulling images can take a while so be patient :)
  
**3. How to start**
  * git clone https://github.com/embano1/Vagrant_Docker_Enterprise
  * cd Vagrant_Docker_Enterprise
  * vagrant up (note: this will launch all four machines by default; one can also select machines, e.g. "vagrant up admiral harbor worker-1")
